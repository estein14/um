Please put answers to questions here.

  1. What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
     black edges?
  
 Answer:
	We found that pbmread used 31.56% of the total instructions calls,
	and pbmwrite ues 25.32%. In total, the I/O takes 56.88%
	
	Removing the black edges takes 43.10% of the total instructions.
	
 2. How long does
  
        time ./unblackedges 
  
     take?
Answer:
	It said that it took about 1.13 seconds in total to run the program.  

  3. After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
     happened to the total time?
  
Answer:
	The total time went from 1.13 seconds, to 1.07 seconds.
	 (It fluctuated everytime we ran it, so we're not totaly
	 sure if the change is significant.

  4. What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?

Answer:
	The fraction went from 7.34% fo the total to 7.37%. This change was
	consistent through all fo the trials.
  
  5. Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
     changed?
  
Answer:
	We changed it from depth first to Breadth first search. We found that
	Seq_addlo requires more checks, therefore spending more time in 
	I/O. Whereas Seq_addhi doesn't take as much time. (Again, we're not 
	positive if our numbers are supposed to be so similar, or if we should
	have seen a greater discrepancy between the two methods.
